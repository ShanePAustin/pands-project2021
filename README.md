# Iris Flower Data Set

## Problem statement 

*This project concerns the well-known Fisher’s Iris data set. You must research the data set and write documentation and code to investigate it. An online search for information on the data set will convince you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed.*

*You might do that for this project as follows:*
1. Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README. 
2. Download the data set and add it to your repository. 
3. Write a program called analysis.py that: 
* outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file 
* saves a histogram of each variable to png files

## Introduction
The Iris flower dataset was introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 in his paper (“The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems”) [3] It focused on how to differentiate Iris species based on the shape and structure of their flowers. The dataset was originally collected by the botanist Edgar Anderson at the Gaspé Peninsula, Canada. Ronald Fisher was regarded by some as the single most important figure in 20th century statistics, and this dataset has since become a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in the areas of statistics and machine learning.

## Data Set

The data set consists of 50 samples from three species of Iris:

|Iris Setosa|Iris Versicolor|Iris Virginica|
